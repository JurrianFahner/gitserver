## Configure your ssh client
In your home directory you can find a directory called `.ssh`, in this directory you can find all the needed config for your commandline client.
If you have ever made a connection to an ssh server, you will find a file `known_hosts`. This file keeps record of all the servers to which you have connected in the past, if something changes on the server e.g. the ip-address the ssh client will warn you about this change.
